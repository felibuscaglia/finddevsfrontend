                <h2 className={style.title}>8. Controls for do-not-track features</h2>
                <p>
                    Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications indlue a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can 
                    activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online 
                    browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform 
                    technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has
                    been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals 
                    or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to 
                    be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must 
                    follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version 
                    of this privacy notice.
